# guess-the-number
This is a game programmed by me entirely in python and its about guessing a number between 0-10, the rooms can be secured by a password. The game is multiplayier and both the server and the client are in the same file. I tested it and it has a lot of bugs, but i dont have any free time, so if someone wants to help i would be greatful.
